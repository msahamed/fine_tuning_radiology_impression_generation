Fine-Tuning Pipeline Steps for Style-Aware Radiology Model

  Phase 1: Data Preparation & Model Setup

  Step 1: Convert Enhanced Data to HuggingFace Format

  - Load our enhanced processed data (26,793 reports)
  - Convert to DatasetDict with train/val/test splits
  - Apply radiology-specific chat template formatting
  - Prepare reference banks for style learning

  Step 2: Create Radiology-Specific System Prompt

  - Design prompt optimized for impression generation
  - Include clinic and modality context awareness
  - Emphasize clinical accuracy and appropriate style

  Step 3: Set Up Model Configuration

  - Load MediPhi-Instruct as base model
  - Configure LoRA with medical-optimized parameters
  - Set up tokenizer with appropriate padding/truncation

  Phase 2: Style-Aware Training Implementation

  Step 4: Implement Style-Aware Loss Functions

  Key Innovation: Multi-objective loss combining:
  - Primary Loss: Standard cross-entropy for impression generation
  - Style Loss: Contrastive learning for clinic-specific patterns
  - Clinical Loss: Medical accuracy and completeness metrics

  Step 5: Implement Contrastive Style Learning

  - During training, extract embeddings from generated impressions
  - Compare with same-clinic vs. different-clinic reference examples
  - Update model to maintain clinical accuracy while adapting style

  Step 6: Configure Enhanced Evaluation Metrics

  Clinical Metrics:
  - BLEU/ROUGE for content overlap
  - Medical entity preservation
  - Clinical reasoning consistency

  Style Metrics:
  - Clinic-specific language similarity
  - Tone consistency (formal vs. concise)
  - Terminology preference alignment

  Phase 3: Training & Validation

  Step 7: Set Up Enhanced Training Pipeline

  - Configure SFTTrainer with style-aware loss
  - Implement dynamic style reference sampling
  - Set up gradient accumulation and memory optimization

  Step 8: Implement Training Loop with Style Learning

  - Standard fine-tuning on findings â†’ impression task
  - Concurrent style embedding comparison
  - Real-time style consistency monitoring

  Step 9: Model Testing & Validation Framework

  Automated Testing:
  - Generate impressions for held-out test set
  - Evaluate clinical accuracy vs. style consistency
  - Compare against baseline MediPhi model

  Clinical Validation:
  - Test on different clinic-modality combinations
  - Verify style adaptation without clinical degradation
  - Measure improvement over generic model

  Phase 4: Deployment & Optimization

  Step 10: Save & Deploy Enhanced Model

  - Save LoRA adapter with style capabilities
  - Create inference pipeline with clinic/modality conditioning
  - Upload to HuggingFace with proper documentation

  Key Differences from Standard Fine-Tuning:

  | Standard Approach             | Our Style-Aware Approach             |
  |-------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
  | Single objective (generation) | Multi-objective (generation + style) |
  | Generic medical language      | Clinic-specific adaptation           |
  | Fixed training examples       | Dynamic style reference sampling     |
  | Basic evaluation metrics      | Clinical + style consistency metrics |
  | Context-agnostic              | Clinic/modality-aware conditioning   |

  The core innovation is simultaneous learning: the model learns to generate clinically accurate impressions while adapting to institutional style
  preferences, all within a unified training process rather than separate fine-tuning stages.
