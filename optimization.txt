Multi-Objective Training Framework

  Weighted Loss Function:
  Total Loss = α × CrossEntropy + β × (1-ROUGE) + γ × Style_Loss + δ × Clinical_Loss

  Where you can incorporate:
  - Style Consistency Loss: Train embeddings to match clinic-specific writing patterns
  - Clinical Completeness Loss: Ensure key findings mentioned in input appear in impression
  - Uncertainty Calibration Loss: Penalize inappropriate confidence levels

  Context-Aware Single Model Approaches

  1. Prefix/Instruction Tuning:
  Input: "[CLINIC: clinic_1] [MODALITY: MR] [ANATOMY: knee] FINDINGS: ..."
  Target: "IMPRESSION: ..."
  This allows the model to adapt style while remaining unified.

  2. Embedding Conditioning:
  - Add learnable clinic/modality embeddings to input
  - Model learns to modulate output style based on context vectors
  - More elegant than explicit prefixes

  3. Multi-Task Learning:
  - Primary task: Generate impression
  - Auxiliary tasks: Predict clinic style, modality type, anatomy
  - Shared representations improve generalization while maintaining specificity

  Radiologist-Centric Metric Integration

  During Training:
  - Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF): Use radiologist preferences as reward signal
  - Contrastive Learning: Train model to distinguish good vs. poor impressions from same findings
  - Style Transfer Objectives: Learn to maintain clinical accuracy while adapting to institutional voice

  Custom Evaluation Framework:
  def radiologist_score(impression, reference, context):
      return (
          0.3 * rouge_score(impression, reference) +
          0.2 * clinical_completeness(impression, findings) +
          0.2 * style_consistency(impression, clinic_id) +
          0.2 * appropriate_uncertainty(impression) +
          0.1 * length_appropriateness(impression)
      )

  Implementation Strategy

  Phase 1: Train unified model with context tokens and multi-objective loss
  Phase 2: Add human preference learning through radiologist feedback
  Phase 3: Fine-tune with reinforcement learning using composite radiologist-centric reward

  This approach gives you the scalability of a single model while maintaining the clinical relevance and style adaptation that radiologists value.
  The key is making the context (clinic, modality, anatomy) an explicit part of the model's conditioning rather than requiring separate models.
