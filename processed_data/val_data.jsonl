A 2nd but smaller lesion within the L3 vertebral body with similar appearing signal characteristics is also noted, this is along the left lateral aspect of the L3 vertebral body. This also probably represents osseous hemangioma. A small lesion along the right lateral aspect of the L1 vertebral body is also noted. Signal characteristics and morphology suggest hemangioma is well. There several smaller areas of more distinctly abnormal signal intensity which are low in signal intensity on the T1 weighted images and of higher signal intensity on the T2 weighted and fat-suppressed images.

Additional areas of abnormal signal intensity are noted within the L5 vertebral body, and probably within the S1 vertebral body as well. Smaller suspicious lesions are noted along the left posterolateral aspect of the L3 vertebral body and within the L4 vertebral body as well.
