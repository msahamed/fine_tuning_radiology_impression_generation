Enhanced Data Preprocessing Pipeline Steps

  Step 1: Data Loading & Basic Setup

  - Load 30,135 original reports from CSV
  - Create mapped_clinic_id from raw clinic hashes (clinic_1 through clinic_6)
  - Group modalities: MR, CT, CR, US, XR, NM → keep separate; all others → "OTHER"

  Step 2: Comprehensive Clinical Field Extraction

  - Extract 8 clinical fields from structured_report_dict:
    - findings (primary clinical observations)
    - impression (radiologist conclusions)
    - history (patient background)
    - indication (reason for study)
    - technique (imaging methodology)
    - comparison (prior studies)
    - clinical_history (detailed history)
    - procedure (procedural details)

  Step 3: Multi-Field Content Synthesis

  Key Innovation: Create composite_findings by intelligently combining multiple fields:

  If findings exist and are substantial (≥20 chars):
  - Use findings as primary content

  If findings are missing/minimal (<20 chars):
  - Start with available findings
  - Add history/indication for clinical context
  - Add technique summary (first 200 chars) for procedural context
  - Add comparison if available for temporal context
  - Add fallback findings "[See clinical context above]" if no substantive findings

  Example Output:
  HISTORY: Professional football player. Effusion. Synovitis.
  TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar, multisequence MR imaging...
  FINDINGS: No prior study.

  Step 4: Enhanced Quality Filtering

  Relaxed but Smart Criteria:
  - Basic fields required: impression, clinic, modality, composite_findings
  - Impression length: 10-1000 characters (unchanged)
  - Total clinical content: ≥30 characters across ALL fields combined
  - Result: 26,793 reports retained (88.9% vs. 45.8% previously)

  Step 5: Training Input Format Creation

  Enhanced Input Structure:
  [CLINIC: clinic_1] [MODALITY: MR] {composite_findings} IMPRESSION:

  Where {composite_findings} contains the intelligently assembled clinical content from Step 3.

  Step 6: Stratified Dataset Splitting

  Maintains clinic-modality representation:
  - Large segments (≥100): Standard 70/15/15 split
  - Medium segments (20-99): 60/20/20 split for better validation
  - Small segments (<20): Custom split ensuring representation in all sets

  Step 7: Reference Bank Creation

  - Style learning preparation: Up to 100 impression examples per clinic
  - Purpose: Enable contrastive learning for institutional style patterns

  Step 8: Multi-Format Output Generation

  Files Created:
  - train_data.jsonl - OpenAI fine-tuning format
  - val_data.jsonl - Validation set
  - train/val/test_data.csv - Full structured data
  - reference_banks.json - Style learning references

  Key Improvements Over Basic Pipeline:

  | Aspect               | Basic Pipeline            | Enhanced Pipeline
     |
  |----------------------|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ---|
  | Data Retention       | 45.8% (13,803 reports)    | 88.9% (26,793 reports)
     |
  | Clinical Fields Used | 2 (findings, impression)  | 8 (findings, impression, history, indication, technique, comparison, clinical_history,
  procedure) |
  | Input Strategy       | Require complete findings | Synthesize from multiple fields
     |
  | Training Examples    | 9,649                     | 18,742
     |
  | Clinical Validity    | High but limited          | High with broader context
     |

⏺ The enhanced pipeline's core innovation is intelligent content synthesis - instead of discarding reports with minimal findings, we create rich
  clinical context by combining available metadata, nearly doubling the usable training data while maintaining clinical validity.
