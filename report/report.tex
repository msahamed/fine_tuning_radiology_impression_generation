\begin{abstract}
This report presents a comprehensive approach to automated medical impression generation from radiology findings using fine-tuned large language models. We developed a findings-focused data processing pipeline that filters for substantial clinical content, implemented quality-based segmentation strategies, and fine-tuned Microsoft's MediPhi-Instruct model using LoRA adapters. Our approach processes 30,135 de-identified radiology reports across 6 clinics, ultimately training on 13,190 findings-rich reports. The methodology emphasizes clinical accuracy, communication style consistency, and scalable deployment within budget constraints.

\section{Introduction}

Automated impression generation from radiology findings represents a critical application of generative AI in healthcare, potentially reducing radiologist workload while maintaining clinical accuracy. This technical assessment demonstrates a practical approach to fine-tuning specialized medical language models for generating contextually appropriate impressions that match institutional reporting styles and clinical requirements.

\section{Exploratory Data Analysis}

\subsection{Dataset Overview}
Our analysis began with 30,135 de-identified radiology reports spanning 6 clinics with diverse imaging modalities. Key findings from our EDA include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Modality Distribution}: MR imaging dominates (59.9\%, 18,046 reports), followed by CT (17.7\%, 5,322), CR (7.3\%, 2,205), US (7.1\%, 2,139), XR (2.9\%, 879), and NM/Other (1.1\%, 143)
    \item \textbf{Clinical Content Quality}: Only 46.8\% (14,091 reports) contain both substantial findings ($\geq$100 characters) and complete impressions
    \item \textbf{Clinic Variation}: Significant heterogeneity in reporting styles, with some clinics favoring structured numbered lists while others use paragraph format
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data Quality Assessment}
Critical filtering revealed substantial data quality challenges:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 1,401 reports (4.6\%) missing basic metadata (clinic, modality, or structured content)
    \item 14,372 reports (47.7\%) with insufficient findings content ($<$100 characters)
    \item 1,387 reports (4.6\%) with inadequate impression sections
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Key Insights}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Findings-Rich Focus}: Reports with substantial findings ($\geq$100 characters) demonstrate significantly higher clinical value and impression quality
    \item \textbf{Modality-Specific Patterns}: Different imaging modalities exhibit distinct reporting conventions and complexity levels
    \item \textbf{Clinic Style Diversity}: Clear institutional preferences for formatting, terminology, and level of clinical detail
\end{enumerate}

\section{Segmentation Strategy and Justification}

\subsection{Evolution from Clinic-Based to Quality-Based Segmentation}

Initially, we pursued clinic-based segmentation to capture institutional reporting styles. However, clinical feedback revealed that quality-focused segmentation better serves the core objective of generating medically accurate impressions.

\subsection{Implemented Segmentation Approach}

\subsubsection{Findings-Rich Filtering}
We implemented stringent quality filters prioritizing clinical substance:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Minimum Findings Length}: 100 characters (ensures substantial clinical observations)
    \item \textbf{Impression Completeness}: 20-1000 characters (excludes fragments and overly verbose entries)
    \item \textbf{Essential Fields Only}: Focus on findings and impressions, excluding auxiliary metadata
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Quality-Based Categories}
Our analysis identified three primary segmentation dimensions:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Communication Styles}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Structured-Detailed: Numbered lists with comprehensive coverage
        \item Formal-Brief: Concise, clinical terminology
        \item Technical-Detailed: Extensive anatomical specificity
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Clinical Complexity}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Normal/Negative: No significant findings
        \item Critical/Acute: Urgent clinical findings requiring immediate attention
        \item Complex/Multi-finding: Multiple anatomical systems involved
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Modality-Specific Requirements}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item MR: Detailed soft tissue characterization
        \item CT: Cross-sectional anatomy emphasis
        \item CR/XR: Focused abnormality identification
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Justification}

This quality-based approach offers several advantages:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Clinical Relevance}: Emphasizes medically meaningful content over institutional preferences
    \item \textbf{Scalability}: Generalizes across institutions without requiring clinic-specific training
    \item \textbf{Efficiency}: Maximizes training value from high-quality examples
    \item \textbf{Performance}: Focuses model learning on clinically substantial cases
\end{itemize}

\section{Fine-Tuning Approach and Results}

\subsection{Model Selection}
We selected \textbf{Microsoft MediPhi-Instruct} as our base model due to its:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Medical domain pre-training and instruction-following capabilities
    \item Proven performance on clinical text generation tasks
    \item Efficient fine-tuning characteristics suitable for budget constraints
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Technical Implementation}
Our fine-tuning approach leveraged efficient techniques to stay within the \$100 budget:
